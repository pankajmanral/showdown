ORM Queries - 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fetch a single object from the database that matches the given query parameters.

.get() -    If it finds exactly one object matching the query, it returns that object.
            If no object matches, it raises a "Model.DoesNotExist" exception.
            If more than one object matches the query, it raises a "Model.MultipleObjectsReturned" exception.

Use Case: Use this when you expect only one record to match, such as fetching a unique user by their username or id.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fetch all objects that match the given query parameters as a QuerySet (which is iterable).

.filter() -     Returns a QuerySet containing all matching objects.
                If no objects match, it returns an empty QuerySet (instead of raising an error)

Use Case: Use filter when you expect multiple records to match or want to handle cases where there might be no matching
